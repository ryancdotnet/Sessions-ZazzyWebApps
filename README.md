# Sessions-ZazzyWebApps

In this session, we talked about adding some "Zazz" to your web applications through the power of CSS. And not just standard CSS styles, but with more advanced tools like transitions, animations, and transforms.

In this repository, you will find the Atlas demo project I created to showcase a few cool techniques for web applications.

The Atlas Project showcases:
* Single Page Application design
* ASP.NET MVC
* ASP.NET Web API
* Various CSS styling techniques
* Knockout binding
* and more!

I tried to keep everything as basic as possible to help reduce clutter and business logic confusion. The focus is not on the app itself, but how it works technically.

I would suggest downloading a copy of this repository and opening up the Visual Studio solution and running it. (Ensure that you start both the Atlas.WebApi AND Atlas.WebApp projects together. You can start both projects automatically in VS with the settings on Menu->Debug->Set Startup Projects)
